# Fastbook_colab
It is just the fastbook notebook version that works for colab after I ran it from here: https://github.com/fastai/fastbook.
Thanks for http://muellerzr.github.io/ for building walkthru for fastai on fastaiv2. 
The denpedacy will also use his solution and adding some of my solution to make things work.
